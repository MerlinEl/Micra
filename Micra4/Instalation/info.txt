here is latest upgrade, remade and tested in 3dsMax 2014, should be ok for new versions too.


instalation:

1) Unpack zip file anywhere in hd, like C:\Micra4

2)drag and drop file _Loader.ms in to 3Ds Max window.


If you get some erors on restart max, that means some files is missing.

You can copy them manualy.


a) C:\Micra4\App\avg_dlx90.dlx ----> C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2014\plugins\avg_dlx90.dlx

b) C:\Micra4\Micra_Macro.mcr  -----> C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2014\en-US\UI\MacroScripts\Micra_Macro.mcr


then should be all fine


enjoy you work , best regards
