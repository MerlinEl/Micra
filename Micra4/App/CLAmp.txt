[To do list / Wishlist]
------------------------------
/PLSAVE should be able to generate M3U8 files (UTF-8 encoded playlists)
Create an option to randomize the playlist (what winamp does when hitting Shift-Ctrl-R in playlist)
Add some debug mode and/or extended information for troubleshooting
Create an option to change output plugin (/OPSET)
Create an option for setting a skin

Version 1.13 - Aug 2008
-----------------------
/medialib was not working - fixed
/pladd - directory parsing partially rewritten (code shared with /load, /loadnew, /loadplay so impacts the four of them)
/pladd - was not working with https due to a bug
/pladd - was considering strings starting with something different from http as a local filename, thus misleading for other protocols
(rtsp://... would be considered as a filename, not as a network location).
Extend /visuexec to /visuexec {on|off|status} (not working)
/OUTPUTPLUGIN - new synonym for /OPGET
/playpause used to be an alias for /pause, now they behave differently
	/pause remains unchanged and toggles pause - if winamp is not playing, pause toggling will do nothing
	/playpause new behaviour : if playing, same as /pause - if not playing, same as /play
/jumptofile opens the "Jump to file" dialog window
/tofront - new
