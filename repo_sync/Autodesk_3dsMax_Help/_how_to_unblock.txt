The Windows operating system considers .CHM files downloaded from
the Internet to be a security risk, and blocks them from running any
scripts or displaying any page content.

If your .CHM file does not load any help pages into the main content
panel, you may need to unblock it.

To unblock your .CHM file:

1.	Find the file in Windows Explorer.
2.	Right-click the file and select "Properties" from the contextual
	menu.
3.	On the General tab, click the "Unblock" button.
4.	Re-open the file.

If the "Unblock" button does not appear, or if the file still does not
show any content:

-	Ensure that there are no special characters anywhere in the path
	and file name of the .CHM file. The # and . characters are known
	to prevent CHM files from displaying correctly
-	Ensure that you are not trying to open the file from a network
	location or shared folder. Move it to a location on your computer.
