If you encounter some licensing problem here is the checklist before contacting the support



First things to check [For Personnal licenses & Trials] :

1.	Active Internet connexion is required. [No Internet = No KeyHydra].
2.	Do not have 2 versions of 3dstudio max open at the same time. [Please check the windows task manager]


First things to check [Studio Licenses] :

1.	Active Internet connexion is required. [No Internet = No KeyHydra].
2.	Do not have 2 versions of 3dstudio max open at the same time. [Please check the windows task manager]
3.	Check windows task manager FOR “acLAN.exe” [In the Details Tab]. If “acLAN.exe” is missing go to ‘If the server is not running above’
4.	Press the windows key/or Windows Start Menu and type : ‘Monitor’ it will open the ‘Lan License Server Window’ there you should see if the server is running on your machine or not.
5.	If you Motherboard or Ethernet Card changed, it mean that your MAC Address changed –> You need to contact support.
6.	If for any reason your MAC address changed you need to contact the support –> You need to contact support.
7.	If your pc do act as the license server [Mostly if you purchased only one license ] PLease do NOT change the server license keep it to Host : 127.0.0.1

-If the server is running :

1.	Restart max and than go to Main Menu –> KeyHydra –> Show
2.	The Keyhydra window will open from there just go to : ‘Help’ menu and press ‘Check license’
3.	Wait 5 seconds.
4.	Than go to ‘Help’ menu ‘about’
5.	If status is ‘Ok to run’ you’re done !
6.	If status is still ‘Can’t check in’ you should probably contact us : sales@onikanabo.com

-If the server is not running :

1.	 Be sure you installed it within the KeyHydra installer [it’s required].
2.	You can start the Licensing Server Manually –> Windows Start Menu –> Activation Cloud –> Start [Please right click run as administrator].
3.	Wait a bit and launch max.


And if it still doesn’t work than drop us a mail.
