<H3>General Usage:</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Select the surface you want to draw on (the surface should be a mesh, and ideally have all modifiers temporarily turned off).</LI>
	<LI>Set the options below as needed.</LI>
	<LI>Hit "<I>Draw</I>", and trace along the selected surface.<BR>
		You can draw multiple splines, one after the other, and change any of the options below while drawing.
	</LI>
	<LI>Right click to end the drawing session, and the actual splines will be constructed and attached to the surface (if needed).</LI>
</UL>

			<LI><B>Linear/Smooth:</B><BR>
				Sets whether the drawn spline will be smooth or not.
			</LI>
			<LI><B>Link Spline To Surface:</B><BR>
				If on, the drawn spline will be attached to the surface so it will follow it while animating.  This can cause spline creation to take a while if on.

			<LI><B>Line/Knot:</B><BR>
				These color swatches set what color the spline and its link points will be (the link points will only be created if "Link Spline To Surface" is on).<BR>
				You can use the dropdown arrows next to the swatches to quickly choose a color.
			</LI>
			<LI><B>Drawing Accuracy:</B><BR>
				Sets the minimum amount of space between knots as the spline is drawn.<BR>
				Settings this to a larger number will keep the number of knots to a minimum.
			</LI>
		</UL>
	</LI>
	<LI><B>Erase Last Line:</B><BR>
		Erases the last line drawn.<BR>
	</LI>
	<LI><B>Draw:</B><BR>
		Click to begin drawing.<BR>
		Right click in the viewport to stop drawing, and actually create the splines that were drawn (this step can take a while, so there are two progress bars provided.  The top one shows total progress for all splines, and the bottom one shows progress for the current spline).<BR>
