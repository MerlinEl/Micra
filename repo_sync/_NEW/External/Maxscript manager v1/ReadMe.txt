Thanks!
I will try it as soon as I got time and send you feedbacks.

Now, I’m using a combination of Notepad++ with SourceCookifier plugin where I have set custom made regular expressions to detect structs, functions, globals,…
Over that, I have created a Maxscript.api from 3dsmax for auto-completion.

I will compare both solutions to see pros and cons.
