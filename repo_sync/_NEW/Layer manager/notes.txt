------------- NEW FEATURES / FIXES beta 01.60 ---------------

- fixed a bug. adding a layer to world layer now removes it from the layer it was previously on

- added feature: select objects on layer.  opens selectin dialog with only object contained on the layer.

------------- NEW FEATURES / FIXES beta 01.50 ---------------

- fixed a bug in merge layer
- fixed a bug that was causing light color to go black when added to a layer...

NOTE: Because of this bug I have changed some internal structures of layer manager that
will cause problems with old files.  The problems will exist with Alternate Materials...
ie turning them on/off, editing them, etc.  The only way to aleviate this problem is to 
destory the layer manager data and rebuild the layers. Do the following:
1) More Options --> Manage Layers --> Create Selection Sets
2) More Options --> Destory Layer Manager Data
3) More Options --> Manage Layers --> Aquire Selection Sets
This will rebuild your layers and place appropriate objects on them.
You will loose any layer data ( alt material, render settings, etc.)

ALSO NOTE: If a file has a layer which is in alternate material mode, I would suggest
returning those layers to normal mode prior to upgrading.  However if it is too late, 
each of the alternate materials for the objects store the old material as the second material
in a blend...So you can retrieve them with some work.
I appologize for the inconvience.


------------- NEW FEATURES / FIXES beta 01.40 ---------------

- fixed the "gather objects" method...again.

- fixed some of the delete group ui re-draw problems

- added Aquire selection set and create selection sets.

- made a fix to alt material assignment that was causing problems if your file 
crashed.

- fixed a problem with a conflict between alt materaial "recieve shadows" and 
layer propererty "recieve shadows"

- fixed the world layer menu

------------- NEW FEATURES / FIXES 01.30 ---------------

- extended menus on groups updated with more appropriate options.

- fixed some layer properties "tab" problems

- fixed the bug in autoassignment that permitted it from being disabled.

- fixed the "gather objects" method.

- added: shift click on extended menu selects the layer

- added: select layer to right click layer menu

- added: inital test of drag and drop features in objects list.
	note: after dragging, the view doesn't update, groups are not supported and it's real simple right now.

- fixed destroy lm data..now deletes change handler too...ooops.

- modified the when statement that enabled autoassignment.  If you're autoassigning
objects to a hidden layer, the layer is now unhidden.  

- found a bug that was destroying LM data...but a restriction in max prevents me from fixing:
DETAILS: If you have a file that contains LM data and it is opened on a machine that doesn't
have the LayerManger Structures file in the stdplugs/stdscript directory, this LM data is destroyed.
So, if you hand files off and you want the LM data to remain, make sure you have this file on the
persons computer.

- made some tweaks to help there always be an active layers selected.



------------- NEW FEATURES / FIXES 02.00 ---------------

- Objects menu in properties has been created.  The active x
	controller lists the layers and the objects in that layer.
	The item can be clicked or shift clicked to select it.
	RENAMING DOESN"T WORK.

- 'Remove Empty Layers' is enabled and working.

- 'Alphebetize Layers' is enabled and working.
	note - when the sort happends all capitals are placed
	before lowercase so "Layer1" comes before "apple Layer"

- Fixed 'Select Layer'

- Increased the time for for a large group of selected objects to be turned
	into a layer.  test case 2000 objs 35seconds to 8seconds.

- Alternate Material enabled and working ( i think )

- created the method for adding atmospherics and elements to rendering parameters.

- set the save flag to dirty after a layer has been made and many other opertations.

- adding selected objects to a hidden layer, objects are deselected now.

- set render settings enabled and working.  The new atmosphics and effects selections now
	work.  When enabled, all atmospherics are turned off except those in the list.

- Xref Scenes as layers enabled and working.

- added 'gather objects' to the main extende menu. This option can be used to import old
	lm data, or to update a scene that contain objects that don't appear to be on any
	layer.  This function is different than the Gather Merge data, which only should be
	used after a file merge has taken place.   However, this operation will place objects
	on a layers, but will not get any of there data like the merge operation will.










	   LAYER MANAGER 3.0 SCIPT INFO
		  October 11, 2001
-------------------------------------------------------

The code for this version of LM is basicly rewriten to be faster, more efficent,
cleaner, and solve old max & maxscript problems.

The storage method -persisant globals- is the same, however the structure
for the storage is different.  

The persistent global is re-defined at each launch of LM with different name.
the variable LM references this p-glob variable.
The actual p-glob variable name is stored in appdata globaltracks[1] 9901
This string is gathered and executed at launch.

Several different structures are used to store the data.

Struct Layer - includes all the data for an individual layer. this includes
	layer properties, rendering information, object information,etc.
	objects are stored by both a unique id string and a node handle id.
	both methods are used to facilitate merging.

Struct Layer_manager - contains functions and data for the system.


Struct LM_UI - contains a few funtions to create and maintain the ui and it's friends.

rollout_creator.ms has been expanded to include a struct for rcmenu creation.


To find properties of Layermanager:
	getPropNames LM

to find properties of a layer
	getPropNames LM.Layers[2]

	LAYER MANAGER 3.0 NOTES - ALPHA 01.00
		  October 11, 2001
-------------------------------------------------------

- Please send all bugs, comments or suggestions to david@rezn8

- This new version of LM is NOT compatible with the previous version!
	They can both reside on your system at the same time, but launching
	the old version will kill the ability to launch the new version.

- Many features that were in the old versions are not enabled yet. 
	They will be added in future versions.

------------- NEW FEATURES / FIXES 01.00 ---------------
- Updated UI

- Added Groups.  Accessed through individual layer extended menus.
	Actions on groups cascade down to layers inside that group.
	If a property on the group level is changed, that property will be
	changed on all sub layers. 
	
	To create a Layer: click on a layers extended menu > group > make new group

	To added a layer to a group: > group > select the group name from the list

- Updated World Layer functionality. 
	World layer now includes all properties that a normal layer has.  The world
	layer cannot be deleted.  Any object not included on another layer is contained on 
	the world layer.  Objects by default do not assume the world layer properties. This
	can be enabled in the properties dialog.

- AutoAssigment Default is now ON.  This means objects created will be placed on the
	active layer. Autoassigment can still be disabled through the 'more options' 
	extended menu

- Layer Properties now include all object properties and a gaggle of rendering properties.
	The object and other areas have not been addressed.

- Rendering Properties now includes an area for atmospheric and effects to be added.  THIS IS ONLY 
	STAND IN.  IT IS NOT WORKING IN ANY WAY.  IT IS JUST A UI SPACE FILLER.  

- 'Automatic Layer Setting Assignment' is now on by default.  When enabled, objects added to a
	layer automaticaly assume all the properties of that layer.

- Merging: When a merge happens, any LM data that exists in the merging file will be imported, 
	but will not overwrite the existing data.  I have removed all merge callbacks because of 
	multiple problems they were causeing, and have replaced them with a MANUAL method.  
	> More Options > Manager Layers > Gather Merge Data.  This command will scan the scene for 
	new objects and new layer information and create new layers for objects that have layer data
	that isn't represented in the current LM.  While this method may not be as seemless as the 
	previous method, my hope is that it will be much more reliable. 

- Right Click Menu - add objects to a layer, or create a new layer from selected.
	I would have much prefered to make this part of the standard quad menu, but maxscript 
	(as far as i can tell) doesn't allow you to create dynamic quad menu items.
