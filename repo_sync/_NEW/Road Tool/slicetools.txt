This script will add a new set of functions and buttons to the Slice Modifier when you add a slice modifier to an object.

To install, copy slice_tools.ms to your scripts/startup folder and restart 3ds Max. Now new instances of the Slice modifier will get a new rollout called Slice Tools.

This tool is also included with the latest version of Wall Worm and Wall Worm Pro. If you have WW 3.07+ installed, you already have this functionality.
