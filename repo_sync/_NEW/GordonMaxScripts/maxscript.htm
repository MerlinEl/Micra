  <h3>A number of MAXScripts are available for free download here, descriptions 
    below. </h3>
  <p align="left"> I'm not a programmer, but have been developing a set of tools 
    using MAXScript to help create and carve designs straight from within 3D Studio 
    MAX, most of the scripts on this page are spinoffs from the development of 
    this <a href="tech.htm">project</a>.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"> I'd like to thank and acknowledge the help and encouragement 
    of Doug McNabb who wrote an HPGL import function which was the starting point 
    for everything else.<br>
    I'd also like to thank Swami Lama for the amount of time he has spent corresponding 
    via email on numerous MAXScript issues, offering code and advice, and of course 
    Bobo for making so much of his MAXScript code public. For general info on 
    MAX or MAXScript, please visit a few of the links below.<br>
    I hope you find some of this stuff useful, there are no doubt some bugs and 
    cases where the scripts could work more effeiciently, if you have any comments 
    or bug reports, please email me directly at <a href="rab@rainnea.com"> rab@rainnea.com</a>

        <h3>CNC Toolkit:</h3>
        <p>Although this script is under early development for our own use, it 
          has given us far more accurate control over how our CNC machine operates 
          and flexibility than the software supplied with the machine or many 
          commercially available packages. </p>
        <h3>Functions include:</h3>
        imports and exports HPGL format toolpaths<br>
        send toolpath directly to machine<br>
        create planing toolpaths<br>
        project toolpaths onto surface of mesh<br>
        limited machine function control 
        <h3>Functions to implement include:</h3>
        <p>offset contours, possibly using vornoi method<br>
          read position info back from machine<br>
          toolpath preview<br>
          Adapt to form universal HPGL Plotter Driver <br>

        <h3>Contour Creator:</h3>
        <p>Creates a series of contours from a selected mesh.<br>
          Has the option of combining all contours and welding any vertices within 
          the Threshold amount which although slow, gives a far better end result 
          as otherwise the contours are composed of many small splines with coincident 
          vertices.<br>
          If &quot;Weld all Contours ?&quot; is left unchecked, a selection set 
          of contour lines will be created. You can always use the weld function 
          in the next script to add and weld these together.<br>

        <h3>Fuse n' Weld:</h3>
        <p>Takes all vertices in a shape, compares them to their closest neighbour 
          and moves them to an average position if within the threshold.<br>
          &quot;Fuse&quot; moves only, &quot;Weld&quot; moves and welds.<br>
          If many vertices are within the threshold, it only operates on the closest 
          so it may be nesseccary to run the script a couple of times.<br>
          If multiple shapes are selected then all shapes are combined.<br>
          &quot;Detach All Splines&quot; dissolves a shape or shapes into it's 
          component splines.<br>

        <h3>Refine Spline:</h3>
        <p> Adaptively adds extra points to a shape while retaining the shape's 
          existing points and curvature. Most useful if a curve's vertices are 
          converted to corner, or if in our case you're doing point to point machining.<br>
          In the exmple to the left, the top test curve is the original, the middle 
          is the same curve with its vertices converted to corners, the bottom 
          curve has had Refine Spline applied to it prior to the vertices being 
          converted to corners.</p>

        <h3>Optimise Spline: </h3>
        <p> Adaptively removes points from a curve while retaining the shape's 
          existing curvature.<br>
          In the example on left, compare the top and bottom test curves, while 
          the lower curve contains around a third less vertices, it still retains 
          the original shape. Experimant with the variables to get the best results.</p>
