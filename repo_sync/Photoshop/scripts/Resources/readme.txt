History:
1.1: Rewrote the script for PS7 support.
     Removed Version Numbers from file names, so in future, updating will be
     easier if you recorded actions.
1.0: Fixed a bug where the script would break when processing empty layers.
     The script now properly handles bigger than canvas layers, fixes the
     problem automatically if the user requests.

0.9: First release.
