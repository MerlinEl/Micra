There are a couple different ways of installing XToolkit. You can:
1) Unbundle the zip file and use it as is. All of the non-library scripts
   can be found in single file versions in the xtools/apps directory. You
   can execute them from there or copy them to your Presets/Scripts folder.
   For the most part, it doesn't really matter. However, the XToolkit.atn
   file will not be automatically created.

2) Do a full install (instructions below). This will install the toolkit
   parallel to your Photoshop application directory, modify the scripts in
   xtools/xapps so that their 'includepath' directories point to the right
   place, and generate and load a new XToolkit.atn file that is modified
   to point to the directory where the toolkit has been installed. You should
   only do this if you want the atn file or you want to do script development
   with the toolkit.

Installation Instructions for XToolkit

1) Extract the zip file to wherever your want, like c:\temp or /tmp, for
   instance. We'll call that directory EXDIR.

2) From within Photoshop, execute the script EXDIR/xtools/xapps/Install.jsx.
   This script will do the following:

   2.1) Open a Folder selection dialog. Select the xtools directory
      extracted in Step 1). This step will only occur if Install.jsx gets
      confused about the location where you unzipped the package.

   2.2) Install scripts and other files into the following directories:
      On Windows XP APPDIR, is the folder where Photoshop was installed,
         e.g. app.path.parent, c:\Program Files\Adobe
      On MacOSX, APPDIR is /Developer
      PSDIR (referenced later) is the Photoshop folder.

      APPDIR/
      APPDIR/xtools/xapps
      APPDIR/xtools/xlib
      APPDIR/xtools/xlib/xml
      APPDIR/xtools/docs
      APPDIR/xtools/etc

      Note that the scripts are modified during the installation process so
      that the '//@includepath' directives point to this directory tree.

   2.3) Modify the Action file "xtools/etc/XToolkit-in.atn" to create
      "xtools/etc/XToolkit.atn" so that the paths to the scripts invoked in
      the actions point to the correct directory. This new Action file is then
      loaded into the Actions Palette.

      The actions in this file refer to the scripts in xtools/xapps. They
      require the APPDIR/xtools folders to be in place in order to work.

3) When the Install.jsx script completes (it should take about 10-15 seconds),
   the Actions are ready to be invoked.

4) To verify that the installation was successful:
   a) Load a document.
   b) Run the Action "jsh".
   c) In the lower pane, type in 'listProps(doc)' (without the quotes,
      naturally) and press the 'Eval' button.
   d) You should see immediately see a list of the Document properties
      for the current document.

5) The files that were extracted to EXDIR can now be deleted.

6) Single file, standalone versions of all of the scripts in
   APPDIR/xtools/xapps can be found in APPDIR/xtools/apps.

7) You may wish to copy some of the files from APPDIR/xtools/apps to your
   PSDIR/Presets/Scripts directory if you want them to appear in your
   File->Scripts menu.

8) If you want to give one of the scripts to someone else, be sure that
   you give them one from APPDIR/xtools/apps since that don't require
   anything else from the toolkit.


To Uninstall the toolkit:
1) Delete the APPDIR/xtools directory tree.
2) Remove any files that were manually copied to PSDIR/Presets/Scripts.
3) Remove the XToolkit actions from the Actions Palette
