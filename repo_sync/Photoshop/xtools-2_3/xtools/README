README for xtools

This is the README file for XToolkit. I (xbytor, that is) am the author and
maintainer of the package. There are a couple of things that I bundled in
from other open source packages, and there are several ideas or code that
came from the good people at adobeforums.com on the Photoshop Script forums
as well as others on ps-scripts.com.

COPYRIGHT
This file contains copyright, copyleft, and license information for the files
in this package. There is nothing scary in there. Basically, you can use this
stuff however you want as long as you give credit where credit is due.

INSTALLATION
The instructions for installing this toolkit are here. It's pretty simple,
really. Just extract the zip file to a temp directory and run
xtools/xapps/Install.js from inside Photoshop and you'll be all set.
If not, you can just move the unzipped xtools folder to a folder of
your choosing.
On OS X, the default installation folder is /Developer/xtools.
On Windows, the default installation folder is C:\Program Files\Adobe\xtools.

Enjoy. And remember:
"The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil."
